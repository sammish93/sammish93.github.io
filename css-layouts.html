        <h2>CSS Layouts</h2>
        <p>
          There are many ways of using CSS to create a layout comprised of many different sections of a website. Originally, HTML was used exclusively for both structure and 
          design, but as HTML evolved came a reevaluation of semantic markup, and a discouragement of overexcessive usage &lt;div&gt; tags and unnecessary &lt;br&gt; tags, 
          in favour of moving layout and aesthetics towards CSS in a push towards responsive design and inclusive HTML markup for ease of use with screen readers and search engines.
        </p>
        <h3>Previous Methods</h3>
        <p>
          Previously, layout was done using anchors such as floats, clears,  and 'top', 'left' etc. properties. These still have their uses, but a website under construction 
          right now should steer clear of designing their layout using purely these properties. These properties are great as long as your website is static, and every visitor 
          uses the same monitor, font size, and browser. The problems arise with when the site is accessed using a resolution of significant difference, or font size is altered. 
          Properties such as float also have their issues which can be frustrating to fix, and cause problems to the whole site if every item is relative to another. One 
          example is a &lt;div&gt; collapse, which can arise because of several reasons. One of the most common is when every child element in a container is floated - The parent 
          container collapses on itself and is no longer visible. This can be solved using the width: 100%; and clear: both; declarations, but this is a clunky and unintuitive 
          way to build a website, and adds a lot of excess code to a CSS stylesheet.
        </p>
        <h3>Flexbox</h3>
        <p>
          According to Coyier (2021), he flexbox is a suitable choice when creating layouts on a small scale (such as a specific container). It is dynamic, and changes based on the 
          size of the container, which can also lead to a more responsive site. Flexboxes can be set using the display: flex; declaration, and can be further customised with 
          the 'flex-wrap' property, 'justify-content', 'gap', and 'align-content/items'. Child items can also be reordered without editing the HTML code, and how much flexibility 
          a specific item has can be stated using the 'flex-grow/shrink/basis' properties. There are, however, limitations, and examples of these are an inability to resize and 
          rotate items, and this is often achieved using javascript.

          This is a wireframe illustration of my website. The orange lines illustrate grid columns and rows, and flex items are shown inside a flexbox. Grids and Flexboxes 
          can work together very well!

        <h3>Grid</h3>
        <p>
          Grids are a great choice for specifically creating areas, or grid containers, on the screen with designations, and then designating items to specific grid cells. As 
          seen before, previous methods were merely patching up problems that arose from the shortcomings of CSS to easily create responsive websites, as House (2021) 
          states <q>Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.</q>
          The grid system is intuitive, and was specifically designed to create layouts that are responsive and fluid, and can be easily changed depending on @media devices 
          accessing them. Grids are created firstly by declaring the 'grid-template-rows/columns', and 'grid-template-areas' can be used to give each cell a name. Grid cells 
          declared using the 'grid-template-rows/columns' property can be given a variation of values such as pixels (px), fractions (fr), ems/rems, and auto. The 
          'column/row-gap' properties can be used to space grid items apart from each other. Each child item can then be assigned a 'grid-area', and will be automatically 
          placed there if the area is a rectangle.
