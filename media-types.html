        <h2>Media Types</h2>
        <p>
          Nowadays, a website can be accessed through a variety of different media types. In the early 90s it was typical to access a website through a desktop computer, 
          and while that's still the case, technology has progressed significantly in the context of ways we access websites. Screens can range drastically in size and 
          resolution; smart watches, to mobile phones, to tablets, to laptop and desktop screens, to 50+ inch TVs. There's also the print medium, with HTML and CSS being 
          more commonplace to design a book layout to scale dynamically with e-readers and different sizes of paper sheets. Finally, there's screen readers that help those 
          with visual or physical impairments to access the web where otherwise it would have been difficult. These screen readers make even greater use of semantic 
          markup in the HTML code to convey subtle meanings and user cues which they may have otherwise missed.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS makes use of the @media query to specify a type of media (screen, print, speech), and to alter how the website is delivered to the visitor. Responsive design 
          is now commonplace in web design, and the intention behind it is to deliver a functional site suited to each medium. Mobile phones will often have websites tailored 
          around the fact that they have small screens, and side scrolling is generally avoided, and those with widescreen monitors can make use of the surplus of space 
          they generally have. Targetting the print medium allows the designer to automatically generate page numbers, headers, and footnotes that change based on font sizing, 
          and a subsequent increase in page count. An stripped-down version of the site could also be generated with less emphasis on colour and design, and more 
          emphasis on content, thus making a printout economically friendly (ink-wise), and easy to read. Targetting the speech medium can allow more control of voice 
          personalities and nuances (male/female, young/old, excited/nervous/sad), as well as supplying extra information that a person with a visual impairment may find 
          useful - a more comprehensive description of a picture, or summarisation of a graph or other visual representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, however, downsides to using the @media query. First and foremost, it is extra work that the web designer needs to do, which can be time consuming and 
          frustrating. Control over elements such as preferred screens and browsers are out of reach for the developer, and a need to accept user choice comes first. A website 
          isn't always suitable for every medium, especially smart watches. Thus, it may be more suitable to supply such small screens with a different experience altogether, 
          e.g. an RSS feed. When applied correctly, a comprehensive CSS sheet with many different @media queries and breakpoints can lead to a responsive website and less 
          work in the future as new screen sizes, resolutions, and DPIs develop.
